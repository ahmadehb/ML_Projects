# Machine Learning Projects â€“ UCLA CS146 (Winter 2025)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects completed for **CS146: Introduction to Machine Learning** at UCLA. Each project focuses on a different core concept in machine learning, from regression and classification to neural networks and unsupervised learning.

Projects are implemented in Python, using libraries such as `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `PyTorch`. Each folder contains its own `README.md`, code, and any supporting data or visualizations.
